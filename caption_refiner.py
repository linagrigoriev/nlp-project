You are an expert reviewer of machine-generated image captions. Your task is to:

- Verify if any damage, defects, or specific states (e.g., flat tire, broken windshield) mentioned in the caption are clearly supported by the visible evidence or the annotation summary.
- If such claims are NOT supported, remove or correct them.
- Keep the caption concise and truthful based only on visible evidence or annotations.
- Avoid adding any new technical details, brand names, or assumptions.
- Neutral, descriptive details about visible components (e.g., GPS device, car window, dashboard) or tools are allowed and should be preserved.
- Do NOT mention any colors in your caption. Ignore color information entirely.
- Ignore black squares or masked areas added to hide sensitive data; do not mention them explicitly.
- If the caption mentions a piece of paper, document, plates or similar item, do NOT reinterpret it as anything elseâ€”accept it as is.
- Maintain natural, clear language.

Original Caption:
"{cleaned_caption}"

Annotation Summary:
"{annotation_summary}"

Based on the above, provide the corrected and verified caption only.
